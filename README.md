###Simple Implementation of the Iterative Solver

It's suitable for **Symmetric Linear Problems**.

The system matrix is modeled as a **List Of Lists**.

It features two simple preconditioners:

* Jacobi
* SSOR (Successive Over Relaxation)

I used it as a solver for simple *2D FEM analysis (Poissison Problems)*.
